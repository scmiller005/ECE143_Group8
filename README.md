### Notebook Organization Overview
"ECE143_Group8_Visualizations.ipynb" is the primary notebook displaying all of the relevant graphics generated for our final presentation. 

The rest of the respository is dedicated to all of the code, data, and graphics produced throughout the project. Run the relevant .py or .ipynb files in each folder to view the graphs/results.
* *Note:* much of this did not make it to the final presentation, but is included here to track progress

|File/Folder Name                       |Description |
|:--------------------------------------|:------------|
|All Files                              |Contains every file used throughout the project, including code that never made it to the final presentation|
|County Map AADT - Kexin                |Contains the relevant code for creating the county heatmap based on the AADT data. Final version of the equivalent code in "Data Visualization - Kexin Jacob"|
|County Map Peak Hour - Ian             |Contains the relevant code for creating the county heatmaps based on peak hour data. Final version of the equivalent code in "Data Visualization - Kexin Jacob"|
|Data|Contains all of our cleaned data from the CalTrans dataset. There are multiple iterations of the same data, as three different team members cleaned the data independently and uploaded it to the Drive|
|Data Visualization - Kexin Jacob       |Contains the relevant code for the initial attempts at heatmap generation|
|*AADT_DataVisualization-Scott.ipynb*   |Contains the relevant code for creation of the AADT graphs|
